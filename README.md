# admin_view

Rails 3 generator of CRUD admin controllers, views and specs for existing models.

It uses [meta_search](https://github.com/ernie/meta_search) for search and [kaminari](https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari) for pagination.

## Usage

Include it in your Gemfile:

	gem "admin_view"

Run the generator:

	$ bundle exec rails g admin_view User --search_by name_or_email

The `--search_by` option is not required - if you don't pass it, the form template will come out commented out. However, it's useful most of the time, and you can use any meta_search-compatible expression to search in string or text fields.
